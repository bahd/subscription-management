# Clarity Subscription Management System

## Overview
This project implements a decentralized Subscription Management System using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. The system enables users to create, manage, and cancel recurring payments directly through blockchain-based smart contracts.

## Features
- Create subscriptions with customizable payment amounts and frequencies
- Automatic payment processing
- Subscription cancellation
- Secure, transparent payment tracking

## Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain development environment
- Clarinet (Stacks smart contract development tool)
- Nodejs
- Vitest for testing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clarity-subscription-management.git
cd clarity-subscription-management
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure Clarinet:
```bash
clarinet integrate
```

## Smart Contract Structure
- `subscription-management.clar`: Core contract managing subscriptions
  - `create-subscription`: Create a new recurring payment plan
  - `process-subscription`: Execute scheduled payments
  - `cancel-subscription`: Stop a recurring payment
  - `get-subscription`: Retrieve subscription details

## Testing
Run tests using Vitest:
```bash
npm test
```

## Deployment
Deploy the contract using Clarinet:
```bash
clarinet contract publish
```


## Future Improvements
- More granular subscription management
- Advanced payment scheduling
